Simple client/server code to test concepts of talking to fadc_scalers

This code has a server which generates fake 64bit data and a client
with prints it.

Simplest instructions.

     The server should start from the same window where you
     start rcgui.  Ideally this would be part of startcoda.

  Here is the server

       /adaqfs/home/sbs-onl/logentry_scripts/halla/tcp/restartScServ

  The client is used in scripts that need to run scripts.  

  I'll document it better later, but for now:

To compile

      ./makeit.com

Code is

         clientScaler.c   the client

         serverScaler.c   the server.

The server could run on a hcvme* or npsvme* computer, but
maybe test it on hcvme02 first.  Does no harm.

To run

      ./xser

You have to be careful not to run it twice, so maybe do this

      ./restartScServ

The client runs on cdaql* and can run like this

      ./xclie hcvme02 getdat

hcvme02 is where the server runs
getdat is an argument that current says "get some data"
